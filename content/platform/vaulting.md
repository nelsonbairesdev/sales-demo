Flexible Token Vault Management: Modo offers a highly flexible and secure approach to managing payment tokens. We are agnostic to your current token vault location (e.g., Stripe, Cybersource), meaning you are not required to re-architect your existing systems or immediately migrate your tokenized data.

Centralized Secure Token Vault: While we accommodate existing arrangements, our platform is fully capable of serving as your central, secure token vault host. We can seamlessly exfiltrate and consolidate tokens from disparate locations into our robust vault, simplifying your payment ecosystem and enhancing your control

"Freeing the Hostages": Our unique approach aims to "free the hostages" by allowing you to centralize tokenized data that may be held by various vendors, providing you with greater control over your sensitive payment information. We achieve this by "de-tokenizing" materials from external vaults and securely storing them within our platform's vault, offering flexibility for migration.

Best-in-Class Cryptography: Modoâ€™s platform is built with highly secure cryptography, ensuring the highest standards for protecting your sensitive payment data and offering unparalleled security.
