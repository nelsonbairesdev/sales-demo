Intelligent Routing & Failover: ModoPOP provides advanced features for intelligent payment routing, allowing you to optimize where transactions are sent based on various conditions. We also support failover capabilities, ensuring business continuity even if one provider experiences issues, a critical feature that other platforms may lack.

Enhanced Functionality "Beyond the Mimic": Once integrated, even through API Mimicking, your system can unlock enhanced capabilities without core application code changes. This includes orchestrating multiple downstream services (payment, fraud checks, analytics notifications), sophisticated data transformations, and advanced error handling

Direct-to-Acquirer Connections: Unlike platforms that sit in front of other gateways, Modo connects businesses directly with acquirers such as BFA, Chase, and Wells Fargo. This direct approach removes intermediary layers, potentially leading to better pricing and reduced cost and complexity for your payment processing
